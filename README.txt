MAKE STYLIZED COLOR TEXTURE ATLAS
This tool processes hex color palette files to create 2048x2048px gradient color texture atlases for game development and digital art.
It generates organized texture sheets with color grids and gradients that can for example be used in 3D modelling.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Find .hex files (https://lospec.com/)
- Insert .hex file in this folder
- Run GradientTextureAtlas.bat
- (Don't like the gradients? Run it again, it will override all exports)
- Copy your final .png file somewhere safe
